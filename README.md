#EXPLANATION

Here in CODE 1 I have taken input() as a line of code that takes input from the user and assigns it to variable n, then the input function returns the input as string and try to slice the string n by taking first len(n)-2 characters.

in CODE 2 I checked each element to see if it is equal to the string "Python", If the index is equal to Python then the index of the element is appended to a new list and used "for" function to iterate through the elements.

In CODE 3 I have used simple if /elif function to print the grades of the students respectively.
